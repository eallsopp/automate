This is my first self-directed Ruby project.  
It is a basic tracking tool for individuals to see how they spend their time.

v1.0 Does not have any automation processes, which will be updated as I learn more development.

Gems Used:
 **erubis** - page building whciih is 3x faster than ERB
  **Chartkick** - Utilizes Chart.js for charting inputs from user records
  **SecureRandom** - 64 character asymmetric encryption used to secure 'sessions'
  **BCrypt** - Asymmetric encryption for storing user passwords in the database, used for validation upon sign in
  **PG** - PostgreSQL database connection, utilized locally during development, Heroku upon deployment  **I Love PostgreSQL**
  **Sinatra** - Web framework for a production environment
  **Puma** - Web Server utilized in production environment

Thank you for your feedback.
